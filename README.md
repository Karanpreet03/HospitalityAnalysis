# 🏨 Hospitality Data Analysis & Interactive Dashboard

Welcome to my **Hospitality Data Analysis** project — a hands-on data cleaning, transformation, and visualization project designed to extract key business insights from real-world hospitality data. This project demonstrates my ability to handle messy data, build KPIs, and present insights interactively using **Power BI**.

## 📂 Project Overview

The dataset, obtained from a hospitality platform, includes booking, guest, and revenue-related data. My objective was to clean and explore the dataset, and then deliver a visually intuitive **dashboard** highlighting performance metrics.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**: For creating dynamic, interactive dashboards
- **Python (Pandas)**: For initial data cleaning and transformation
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- **Excel/CSV**: Original data format used for import and cleaning
